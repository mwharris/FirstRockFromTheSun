This game will be a 2.5D side-scroller where you need to avoid the solar flares and complete tasks to get on with your daily life.  

This takes place in the distant future where Earth and Venus have been destroyed due to pollution.  Humanity has now colonized Mercury and has figured out solutions for all the problems that come with that.  However one problem remains: the sun and it's solar flares burning people to a crisp.  Despite that though, people still try to get on with their daily lives.  You play one of these people navigating their way around this new planet trying not to die.
